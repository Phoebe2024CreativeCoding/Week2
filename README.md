# Week2
Week 2 Project
I wanted to create something that generates random flower patterns for my random generator. I began by testing different compositions and sketching my ideas. My goal was to design a flower using simple shapes while, at the same time, making sure that the flowers remain recognizable. 




As I began experimenting, I realized that if the minimum and maximum sizes varied too widely, the flower would start to lose its overall shape, so I set a size perimeter. I also limited the x and y axes to keep the objects relatively within the canvas. At first, I wanted the generator to refresh after every loop; however, I feel that it is better if the code was more interactive, so I chose to refresh each generator after each mouse click. In the end, I felt that the background was too simple, so I changed it to a different color each time to make it look more visually appealing.
